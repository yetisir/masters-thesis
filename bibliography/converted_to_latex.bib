  abstract = {The heterogeneity of hydrogeologic properties at different scales may have different effects on flow and transport processes in a subsurface system. A model for the unsaturated zone of Yucca Mountain, Nevada, is developed to represent complex heterogeneity at two different scales: (1) layer scale corresponding to geologic layering and (2) local scale. The layer-scale hydrogeologic properties are obtained using inverse modeling, based on the available measurements collected from the Yucca Mountain site. Calibration results show a significant lateral and vertical variability in matrix and fracture properties. Hydrogeologic property distributions in a two-dimensional, vertical cross-section of the site are generated by combining the average layer-scale matrix and fracture properties with local-scale perturbations generated using a stochastic simulation method. The unsaturated water flow and conservative (nonsorbing) tracer transport through the cross-section are simulated for different sets of matrix and fracture property fields. Comparison of simulation results indicates that the local-scale heterogeneity of matrix and fracture properties has a considerable effect on unsaturated flow processes, leading to fast flow paths in fractures and the matrix. These paths shorten the travel time of a conservative tracer from the source (repository) horizon in the unsaturated zone to the water table for small fractions of total released tracer mass. As a result, the local-scale heterogeneity also has a noticeable effect on global tracer transport processes, characterized by an average breakthrough curve at the water table, especially at the early arrival time of tracer mass. However, the effect is not significant at the later time after 20\% tracer mass reaches the water table. The simulation results also verify that matrix diffusion plays an important role in overall solute transport processes in the unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain.},

  abstract = {A new plastic-damage model for concrete subjected to cyclic loading is developed using the concepts of fracture-energy-based damage and stiffness degradation in continuum damage mechanics. Two damage variables, one for tensile damage and the other for compressive damage, and a yield function with multiple-hardening variables are introduced to account for different damage states. The uniaxial strength functions are factored into two parts, corresponding to the effective stress and the degradation of elastic stiffness. The constitutive relations for elastoplastic responses are decoupled from the degradation damage response, which provides advantages in the numerical implementation. In the present model, the strength function for the effective stress is used to control the evolution of the yield surface, so that calibration with experimental results is convenient. A simple and thermodynamically consistent scalar degradation model is introduced to simulate the effect of damage on elastic stiffness and its recovery during crack opening and closing. The performance of the plastic-damage model is demonstrated with several numerical examples of simulating monotonically and cyclically loaded concrete specimens.},
